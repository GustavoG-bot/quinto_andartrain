![Illustrative Image](analytics-2158454_1280.png)

## Overview

This project involves leveraging Robotic Process Automation (RPA) with UiPath to perform web scraping, extracting real estate data, and subsequently utilizing data science techniques for analysis and prediction. The primary objectives include data collection, cleaning, exploration, and building a predictive model to estimate property prices based on various features such as the number of bedrooms, property type, parking spaces, and square footage.

## Project Description

### Web Scraping with UiPath

Utilizing UiPath RPA capabilities, the project starts with web scraping to gather real estate data from online sources. UiPath is employed to navigate through web pages, extract relevant information, and store it in a structured format.

### Data Transformation with Excel

The scraped data is transferred to an Excel spreadsheet for further processing. This step involves organizing and formatting the data to prepare it for subsequent analysis.

### Data Cleaning and Exploration

With the data now in a usable format, the project proceeds to clean and explore the dataset. This involves handling missing values, outliers, and other inconsistencies. Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is performed to gain insights into the distribution and relationships within the dataset.

### Predictive Modeling with PyTorch

The core of the project involves building a predictive model using PyTorch, a deep learning framework. A neural network is designed and trained to predict property prices based on key features, such as the number of bedrooms, property type, parking spaces, and square footage.

### Model Comparison

In addition to the neural network, a pre-trained regression model is utilized for comparative analysis. The performance of both models is evaluated to determine their effectiveness in predicting real estate prices.
